# Linux-overview-Desktop-edition
This is my current working knowlege of Linux Desktop since moving from Windows

This will be going over the pros and cons of windows - What I like about linux and ideally how linux can improve over the years from a desktop experience.

# What Windows does well

With windows there is a lot it does well, for example hardware compatibility and software compatibility - This is mainly due to the plug and play nature of windows and having a high market share it means that drivers will be available to install or hardware will automatically work when plugged in like mouses and keyboards.

The GUI does not have a lot of changes excluding windows 8 - Windows 10 and windows 11 have a similar look if you move the start menu in windows 11 to left hand side and the same can be said for other versions of windows normally with the windows versions it is adding new tools and a new coat of paint - This makes moving from one version to another version easy and simple for the end-user it has gotten a lot simpler with the upgrade programme for windows 10 and windows 11 where it was treated like a windows update and installs guides were available if users had any questions or need help with the install.

there are a lot of school that teach windows from a young age for example when I was a kid in primary school our school used windows XP and growing up I used windows XP on my personal PC growing up- This means from a young age you are learning how the windows desktop enviroment works and it means that as you grow up you are more likely going to use windows over other operating system since you have used it before and it is easier to use something you know then try to use a new OS which might have a different way of doing things - Company's also use windows mainly for some of the above reasons but it can also be do to the fact that the non technical users are used to windows since it is installed on most pcs and it is used in schools growing up.
