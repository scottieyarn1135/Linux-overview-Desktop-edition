# Linux-overview-Desktop-edition
This is my current working knowlege of Linux Desktop since moving from Windows

This is more of my personal view of moving from one OS to another reasons why and an info dump of everything I have learn so far.

# What Windows does well

With windows there is a lot it does well, for example hardware compatibility and software compatibility - This is mainly due to the plug and play nature of windows and having a high market share it means that drivers will be available to install or hardware will automatically work when plugged in like mouses and keyboards.

The GUI does not have a lot of changes excluding windows 8 - Windows 10 and windows 11 have a similar look if you move the start menu in windows 11 to left hand side and the same can be said for other versions of windows normally with the windows versions it is adding new tools and a new coat of paint - This makes moving from one version to another version easy and simple for the end-user it has gotten a lot simpler with the upgrade programme for windows 10 and windows 11 where it was treated like a windows update and installs guides were available if users had any questions or need help with the install.

there are a lot of school that teach windows from a young age for example when I was a kid in primary school our school used windows XP and growing up I used windows XP on my personal PC growing up- This means from a young age you are learning how the windows desktop environment works and it means that as you grow up you are more likely going to use windows over other operating system since you have used it before and it is easier to use something you know then try to use a new OS which might have a different way of doing things - Company's also use windows mainly for some of the above reasons but it can also be do to the fact that the non technical users are used to windows since it is installed on most pcs and it is used in schools growing up.

# What made me move away from Windows

Data gathering - I dislike how windows does a lot of data gathering while I do understand that it is Microsofts product and they can do what they want I don't agree that an OS should do a lot of data gathering even harmless data gathering can expose a lot about a user - the difference between Windows doing this and other services such as netflix or amazon for example is that they are websites they are not your OS.

Resource useage I feel like windows is bloated at times I was actually considering getting a CPU upgrade because my mouse was lagging on another screen it does not sound like a big issue but monitoring my useage I was noticing high usage on applications when this should not be the case and it felt like I was looking for issues then enjoying the games I was playing.

Cost of the license I feel like the cost of the license is ridiculous since you are can opt in and out of giving your data so I don't see why I should be paying my OS that also gathers data from me - elementary os which is a linux distro that has a mac look and feel to it has a pay what you want you want with this OS it does not have any data gathering on the OS itself.

Limited choices for what I want to do with the look of windows and the apps I want installed on boot - This is more minor issue then an actual issue - I like the fact that I can change desktop environments if I wanted to on linux (Think of this as a collection of applications,icons,wallpapers and desktop widgets - They also have there own applications for example KDE has the following - Dolphin - File manager, Konsole - Terminal, Krita - Digital painting E.G. - You don't need to install them if you don't want to because it is a choice with windows you need Microsoft edge installed and you need to uninstall all the 3rd party app that it installs on start up - you could create your own ISO but it should be an option on install.
